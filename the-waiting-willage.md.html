Many years ago, in a small village nestled far from the outside world, people knew each other by name and lived in peaceful isolation. Life moved slowly there, following the rhythms of the seasons and the flow of the river that connected them to distant lands.

Then the war came.

The country called for every young man to serve. Even in that remote village, the conscription orders arrived. The journey to the front lines would be long and arduous—travelers would spend weeks moving along the winding river. With so many men to transport, the military arranged them into several batches, loading them onto large boats that would carry them away in a fleet.

Among them was a family's only son. After hurried goodbyes and tearful embraces, he boarded his assigned boat. The family watched from the shore as the vessel disappeared around the river's bend, joining the others in the flotilla bound for war.

The village followed the news closely, hoping for word that the conflict would end soon and their sons would return.

The first several months brought nothing. This seemed reasonable—the journey was long, and there were no messengers traveling the water route. The family tried not to worry.

Several more months passed in silence. People began to speculate that perhaps the military had restricted communications from the front lines. The family took some comfort in remembering their son had been assigned accounting duties. Surely that meant he was safe, working behind the lines with paperwork rather than fighting. Perhaps he was simply too busy to write.

Then, after nearly a year, the neighboring villages began receiving letters. The war was winding down, the young men wrote. There had been casualties, but not many.

Still, the family's village heard nothing.

"No news is good news," people told each other, trying to think positively. At least they hadn't received notice of any deaths.

Young men from the neighboring villages started coming home. They brought stories from the front, tales of battles and comrades. The family's village waited at the dock, scanning each arriving boat.

None of their sons appeared.

Stranger still, the returning soldiers didn't seem to have any information about the men from the village. Perhaps they had been stationed in a different sector, people reasoned. The accounting work might have kept them at a separate camp.

Over the next several months, nearly everyone from the neighboring villages returned—everyone except the men from this one village. No bad news arrived. But no good news came either. Just silence, stretching on and on.

That year brought a terrible drought. The water level dropped lower and lower, week after week, exposing sandbars and muddy banks that hadn't seen sunlight in decades.

That's when people found the boats.

Wreckage after wreckage, scattered along the bottom. All of them resting just hours away from the village. Just beyond the bend where the families had last waved goodbye.
