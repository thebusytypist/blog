My kid has started to get some challenging first grade "math"
problems, and I have guided her on how to solve them.

The problems themselves are not quite interesting from an adult's perspective.
But the key part of this post is to unlearn and re-learn problem solving strategy, stay disciplined
on what tools I am using, and practice my exposition.

!!!
    Some penguins were playing on the ice. Ten of them dove into the water.
    A few seconds later, 6 of those penguins jumped back onto the ice.
    Now there are 12 penguins on the ice.
    How many penguins were on the ice to start? Use numbers, pictures, or words to show
    how you got the answer.


Firstly, refrain from using any kind of equations, or tendency to define an unknown,
no matter if you call it "x" or just draw a square. An equation (and also its associated solving techniques) is indeed a powerful
_tool_ to approach this problem. However, its usefulness on the surface
takes away the essence of a deeper _concept_ too quickly, and in an unconscious way.

What this problem gives is several observations of the number of penguins on ice or in water,
interleaved with penguins' movements between the ice and the water.
The ask is to find out the number of penguins on ice at the beginning.

An immediate reaction to this problem is to follow the penguin activities in a reversed order.
Let me write down this idea.

!!! Tip
    We don't know the number of penguins on the ice at the beginning.
    But the story tells us the number of penguins after they jump into and out of the water.
    We can chase back like a detective and find out how many penguins were
    on the ice at the beginning.

    The key idea is to "undo" the activity that penguins did.
    For example, if a penguin jumps into the water, we let it jump back to the ice in our mind,
    and that will eventually recover how many penguins were on the ice.

    Starting with 12 penguins at the end,
    we learn 6 of them just joined them from the water.
    To "undo" it, we exclude these 6 penguins, and that tells us 6 (12 - 6) were on the ice.
    Proceeding in reverse, 10 of them had left the ice.
    To "undo" it, we add them back to the total number,
    that gives us 16 (6 + 10) penguins were on the ice at the beginning.

While this solves the problem, I don't quite like the reverse process, which usually
requires some explanation, and can lead to unnecessary explanation of the order of events.
I don't like the "undo" idea either, in the sense that we need to do an extra translation
of the direction in which the penguins move.

I want to try a different exposition, by noticing a concept of _conservation_.

!!! Tip
    The total number of the penguins, no matter how they jump between the water and the ice,
    always stays the same.
    If we know the number of penguins in the water and on the ice, then adding them together will
    always give us the number of penguins on the ice at the beginning.

    Let's follow the activities the penguins made, and keep track of the number of penguins
    in the water. Then at the end, when we are told the number of penguins on the ice,
    we can add them together to recover the answer.

    Firstly, 10 penguins joined the "water team".
    Then, 6 of the "water team" left for the "ice team", thus the "water team" has only 4 (10 - 6) left.
    Finally, we know that 12 penguins are on the ice.
    We add the "water team" and "ice team" together, that gives us 16 (4 + 12) penguins.
    Since the total number of the penguins does not change throughout the game,
    we claim that 16 penguins were on the ice at the beginning.


This is much better; I don't have to use any help of reversed process, or undo anything.
Every step is just a straightforward translation of the story into arithmetic.
More importantly, this simple _conservation_ (and also _invariance_) idea is essential
for all more advanced math concepts.

You probably don't realize the power of conservation yet. But let me fast-forward
a bit, to the moment when one wonders why a tensor transform rule
has to be in the form of $\FF \MM \FF^{-1}$. The reason is to have _any_ scalar that
can be computed from the tensor _invariant_ under different spaces.
One example is the trace of the tensor.

$$
\begin{align*}
\tr(\MM) &= M^i_i \\
m^i_j &= F^i_k M^k_l (F^{-1})^l_j \\
m^i_i &= F^i_k M^k_l (F^{-1})^l_i = \delta^l_k M^k_l = M^k_k
\end{align*}
